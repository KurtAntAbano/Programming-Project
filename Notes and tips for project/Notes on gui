for logins we want to be able to control who and how many people can create accounts.

solution 1:
1 account for everyone, password is preset and cannot change and everyone know it

solution 2:
- multi-users
- each with their own passwords and username
- two access rights: Admins and users

admins: create accounts (sent by email), change passwords, delete accounts, etc...

user: change passwords, + other options related to the program


in order to implement solution 2:
u need three windows one for username+password, admin menu, user menu
use attempts and validation
